# Interview Study

Each interview study consisted of 3 main parts: explaining the goal of our study, familiarizing participants with the relationship types, and asking the participants questions about how they use relationship types in practice. 

### Part 1 & 2: Background + Relationship Type Definitions

To familiarize participants with the goal of our research and with *structural, semantic, and evolutionary* relationship types, we showed participants a short (~10 minute) powerpoint presentation that defines the relationship types using small examples.

The slides we used to familiarize participants with relationship types are included in this directory, under interview-study-presentation.pdf.

### Part 3: Interview Questions

1. Which relationship types do you find useful for microservice extraction and why? 
2. If there is more than one useful relationship type, what is the relative importance of each relationship and why?
3. Are there any additional relationship types you find useful?
4. What characteristics of an application/organization could change how you use relationships?

### Data Analysis

For open coding, two of the authors of the paper independently read the interview transcripts line by line and identified concepts - key ideas contained in data. When looking for concepts, we searched for the best phrase that describes conceptually what we believe is indicated by the raw data. On a weekly basis, all the authors met to discuss the identified concepts and to refine and merge them if needed. 

This was done by organizing all interview quotes in an excel document, giving each quote an identifier, and then grouping the identifiers by concept and refining the groupings as needed.
